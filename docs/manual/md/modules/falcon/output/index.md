# Generated output {#documentation .concept}

Documentation can be generated in HTML, PDF and DOCX format. If not reduced by filters, each HTML document contains a tree navigation divided into three main parts - Project documentation, Cross-reference documentation and Quality Assurance documentation. The Project documentation part contains list of projects and each project contains all its resources. Cross-reference documentation shows relationships between projects. Quality Assurance documentation contains list of violations detected in documented projects, QA Rules summary and list of the invalid QA Rules. Navigation items are links to HTML documents and the menu is updated according to actually displayed content. The PDF documentation has bookmarks which are similar in structure to the HTML navigation. The DOCX documentation is another printable file format, which is also easy to edit and format.
