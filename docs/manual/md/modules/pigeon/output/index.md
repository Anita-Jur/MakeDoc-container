# Generated Output {#iProcess .concept}

Documentation can be generated in HTML, PDF and DOCX format \(depends on licensed products\). The Project documentation part contains list of servers and each server contains all its resources. Navigation items are links to HTML documents and the menu is updated according to actually displayed content. The PDF documentation has bookmarks which are similar in structure to the HTML navigation. The DOCX documentation is another printable file format, which is also easy to edit and format.
