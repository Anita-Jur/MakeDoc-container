Documentation can be generated in HTML, PDF and DOCX format. The Project documentation part contains list of projects and each project contains all its resources. Navigation items are links to HTML documents and the menu is updated according to actually displayed content. The PDF documentation has bookmarks which are similar in structure to the HTML navigation. The DOCX documentation is another printable file format, which is also easy to edit and format.
