# CrossReference Documentation {#CrossReferenceOutput .concept}

CrossReference Documentation contains a list of objects, which are used in selected projects. It can be e.g. JMS Queues or Topics used in BW & BE & EMS projects, BW processes called by iProcess procedures etc.

A concrete object documentation contains the visual cross-reference where the user can see near destination neighborhood. Actually opened destination has yellow border for simpler orientation in the diagram. Every diagram element is hyper-linked to its documentation page.
