# Project {#md_project .concept}

Project file represents one TIBCO project to be documented. Includes it's identification and can be seen as reference file. Usually MakeDoc documentation projects include more than one project file. Server installation recursively adds project files automatically based on provided root folder where TIBCO projects/ears are stored. More information about this process can be found in chapter MakeDoc documentation job workflow.

Project file content example:

```

project.name=AccountState
project.url=PATH_TO_PROJECT
project.type=FOLDER
project.identification=vcrepo.dat
			
```
