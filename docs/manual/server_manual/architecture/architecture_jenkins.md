[Jenkins CI](http://jenkins-ci.org) is originally tool designed to support continous integration software development. It is used to maintain and schedule software builds and other repetitive tasks related to software development. Jenkins CI is very flexible and extendable tool. Because of this Jenkins CI was chosen to be basic framework for MakeDoc server. MakeDoc server performs repetitive tasks to generate documentation. Jenkins CI enhanced with MakeDoc plugin together with MakeDoc portal creates complete and comfortable interface for daily use.
