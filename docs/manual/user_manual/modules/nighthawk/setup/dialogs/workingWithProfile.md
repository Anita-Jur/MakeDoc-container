# Working with Profiles {#workingWithProfile .concept}

This part describes how to work with iProcess profiles. Two profiles are created by default. Profiles in general allows user to:

-   start documentation process
-   set output format - HTML, PDF, DOCX
-   set paper format
-   set filter
-   set Storage setting - Storage, Repository location
-   set subset of Units to be documented in this profile when 'Document all units' option is not used.
