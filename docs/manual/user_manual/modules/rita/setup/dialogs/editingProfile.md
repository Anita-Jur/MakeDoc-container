In second bookmark it's possible to select old and new Snapshots. These Snapshots are stored in Storage and this bookmark represents view into Repository. Selection of concrete Snapshot is possible in two ways. First way represents select of Repository and offset number specification. Offset is negative number which represents index in Repository, sorted from new Snapshot to older Snapshot. Zero number in offset means current Snapshot. Second way is to select concrete Snapshot in tree \(offset is set automatically\). In picture old Snapshot is selected by second way and new Snapshot by first one.
