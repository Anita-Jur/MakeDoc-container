# User Defined CrossReference {#userDefCross .concept}

Content of User Defined CrossReference is driven by special files stored in BusinessEvents Module project in folder Templates/cross/def/\*. By editing or adding new files can be automatically added new part of documentation. Adding and editing needs good knowledge of TIBCO BusinessEvents Module processing. **Editing and adding new files is NOT RECOMMENDED**.
