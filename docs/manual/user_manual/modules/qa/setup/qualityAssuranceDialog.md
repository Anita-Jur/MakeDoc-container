# Quality Assurance Dialog {#qualityAssuranceDialog .concept}

**Note:** This dialog is available only if you have purchased product Quality Assurance.

This dialog is used for settings of Quality Assurance module. It is possible to choose which rules will be used during Quality Assurance check. The rule is classified by its group, type and name \(this combination has to be unique within solution\). Chapter also reflects output chapter in documentation and rule's topic group.

It can be opened by clicking on Quality Assurance tab within the **Profile Editor**.
