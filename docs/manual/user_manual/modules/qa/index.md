# Quality Assurance {#qualityAssurance .concept}

**Note:** This feature is available only if you have purchased product Quality Assurance.

Quality Assurance checks whether defined rules were followed in chosen projects and shows all occurrences of violations of these rules. Its documentation can be generated together with project and cross-reference documentation, which brings advantage of hyperlinked resources, or separately as single document. Output itself is divided into three parts - rules, projects and QA statistics. Therefore it is possible to examine violations of rules which weren't followed from this two points of view. In QA statistics is possible find information about QA rules \(list of invalid rules, count of fired rules, count of checked objects\).
