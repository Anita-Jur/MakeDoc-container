# MakeDoc for TIBCO

MakeDoc® provides automatic code review and analysis of TIBCO projects. With a single click, the tool generates technical documentation for your ActiveMatrix BusinessWorks®, EMS server, and other projects or deployments. Based on this analysis, MakeDoc® performs automated code reviews, highlights differences between TIBCO environments or project versions over time, and visually displays dependencies across an unlimited number of TIBCO projects.

## MakeDoc Story

The story of MakeDoc began back in 2007, when our TIBCO consultants needed a fast way to understand complex customer environments. Over time, we added several smart features, transforming a simple internal tool into a mature documentation solution highly valued by our clients.  
MakeDoc was born from real-world experience and built to address the everyday needs of TIBCO consultants.

## Benefits

- Always up-to-date documentation of your environment (time-saving)
- Faster onboarding and training of new TIBCO developers
- Improved code quality (TIBCO-specific)
- Easier error localization and troubleshooting
- Continuous, high-level overview of the development process
